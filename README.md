## About No-CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA

You can find more information on reCAPTCHA [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html). Google introduced a new form of CAPTCHA in 2013 that proved to be easier to solve by humans yet considerably harder for bots to bypass, by introducing a simple checkbox which is all that's needed for humans to pass the verification.

## Instructions

### Generating an API Key

If you haven't already, [generate your API keys first](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin). You will need the **site key** and **secret key**.

### Installation and Usage

This plugin requires cURL to be enabled on your server, as it makes use of Google's [PHP library](https://github.com/google/recaptcha).

1. Copy the `acf-recaptcha` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Activate the plugin via the plugins admin page
3. Create a new field via ACF and select the reCAPTCHA type (under Custom)
4. Enter you site key and secret key into ACF options.

That's it! It should work out of the box, as long as your API keys are correct and valid for your domain.
